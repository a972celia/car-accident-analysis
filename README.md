Introduction :Analysis of road accidents data can reveal various hidden facts. Here in this report we dig into some variables to see how it affected other variables, such as accident of severity, rural and urban area and police officer attend analysis. And in the end of the report we use hypothesis testing to get some further insight of this dataset.


Dataset : The dataset used in the report was derived from the UK police forces for every vehicle collision in the United Kingdom from 2012-2015.
